## An Explanation

For a number of years, I constantly re-designed my home on the internet, tweaking and nudging pixels around the screen, adding grids, styling links. Over a number of days, I *un-*designed it.[^1]

Much the same as any other designer, I can grow discontent with work I've completed in the past, but particularly when that work might contain hints of a retired, transient trend too beautiful to ignore. I shan't offer my opinion here on whether I explicitly believe design trends to be either a positive or negative thing, suffice to say they do change, and increasingly often, at that.

There are, however, perennial elements of design. Things such as eloquent typographic style, preferable line lengths, interlinear spacing. It's for this reason that my site now attempts to pay respect to these principles, with their rich history and many critics.

This website, primarily, is now designed for reading. Easy, obvious, distraction-free reading, in the hope that the reader may find something of use amongst the words. As a designer, I strive to be judged not by visuals alone—nor by any other individual component, I might add—but rather by the process I follow in order to create lasting work that is a joy to use, albeit a quiet, unaware joy. Writing, for that purpose, is the most clear form of communication I have, so I shall take advantage of it. *"Less, but better".*[^2]
