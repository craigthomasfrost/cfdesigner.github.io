title: Dear designer
subtitle: Advice to my younger self
---
This is the advice that I'd like to have read when I was starting out as a designer. I wouldn't have agreed with all of it and, for obvious reasons, have not followed all of it myself (and there exists a very strong argument that you shouldn't either), but at the very least I'd like to have had the opportunity to strongly and publicly disagree with it (this option is open to you).

There exist a great many other things that I could add to this list, but when creating posts like this one I typically write things that come immediately (or at least very easily) to mind, such that I'd give similar advice here to the advice I'd give in person if you (or anyone) were to ask for it.

2. [Reach out to lots of people](#reach-out-to-lots-of-people)

## Discount direct applications
Many of you will start applying for jobs by 1: searching job boards like e.g. Indeed, Monster, and LinkedIn, 2: applying for somewhere between 1 and _n_ jobs, 3: expecting to interview for some fraction of those applied for, and 4: expecting some smaller fraction of those you interview with to send you an offer letter. This process takes a lot of time and emotional energy and rarely produces good results.

Job postings get inundated with low-quality applications, where low quality equals something between _isn't quite the right fit_ and _is applying for a senior position having never performed this job or any job like it_. For that reason alone it's barely worth your good application (which likely exists in the ~5% of good applications, if it's even that high) sitting alongside the ~95% of bad applications.

You might think that existing in the 5% makes your application an obvious diamond in the rough, but factors including but not limited to fatigue place you in an environment that's not particularly conducive to deep thought and analysis. It shouldn't be this way, but for better or worse humans will act like humans; both energy and judgement will be affected by working through a stack of profiles.

It's also true that many of the best jobs do not get posted publicly (or get filled before anyone has the chance), just as many of the best candidates aren't obviously looking for jobs—which means that the typical method might eventually get you a job, but will rarely get you the kind of job that you actually want. Hiring managers know someone (or know someone who knows someone) and the job gets filled offline.

With the above in mind, you'll want to think about how you might hear of these opportunities (both now and in the future), and who you might hear about them from. An obvious solution is to know many more people than you currently do, in positions that put them in charge of hiring people like you. If that seems daunting to you, it won't after you've reached out to a substantially large enough number of people.

Whilst this will depend heavily on the job you're trying to get, find out where those people normally spend their time like e.g. Twitter, LinkedIn, Dribbble, or... email, and send them a short message that offers some idea of who you are, what you're looking for, and how they can help. You don't need to wax lyrical about design and your vision for the future, it can really be as simple as:

> Hi [hiring manager or team member], I'm a product (or communication, or service) designer looking for my next role. I love [project] you worked on and I'd love to chat about opportunities on the team that I'd be a good fit for. My portfolio: [link]. Are you free for a quick call on Friday?

Assuming you've done your research, you have skills that this hiring manager could very well use and you're looking to discuss how they might put them to use. The worst that's likely to happen is that you get no response, and the rest is somewhere between _there's no opportunity but let's keep in touch_ and _you've caught me at just the right time, Friday sounds great_. Either of these is a good outcome.

There are many other ways that you can find people who might help you, including meet-ups, conferences, hack-days, and (broadly speaking) the internet at large. Do your research, find the right people to reach out to, and send them a short message asking for a chat. The several minutes it might take you to do this a handful of times will lead to far more success than countless hours on job boards.

You don't have to reach out to the hiring manager, of course. You could reach out to someone one the team (or even someone who _used to be_ on the team) and ask what it's like to work there. You'll learn a lot more about the job and the folks you'd be working with than you would from a flashy careers page that's light on the details and necessarily focused on broader themes, like mission, purpose, and... free food.

Through the very act of being a human that's reaching out to another, you'll also be seen as one—and you'll get the chance to go deeper on areas that are somewhere between _difficult_ and _impossible_ to communicate on a résumé or in a cover letter (which have a non-zero chance of being totally ignored). Many folks will be glad to hear from you and more than willing to chat about the team.

## Reach out to lots of people
At risk of sounding like a broken record, it's a very good idea to reach out to _a lot_ of people. Hiring managers and potential teammates are a fantastically small fraction of people on the internet and of the people you could connect with. In the vast majority of cases you shouldn't have much of an agenda past _you do great work and I think I could learn something from you_. Many people will be willing to teach you those things.

That doesn't mean you should ask for someones time to _pick their brain_ or because they're internet famous. You have a lot of things to learn from other folks, and if you're going to ask them to give up some of their finite time to chat with you, it's the least you can do to spend time exploring their work, crafting good questions, and being very specific about what you'd like to learn and why you'd like to learn it from them.

Something that might not immediately be clear is that you likely have things to share which will help to provide perspective for those people, too. When I speak with junior designers I very regularly leave the conversations thinking about some specific subject in an entirely new way. Many designers further along in their career have forgotten useful lessons, or cut their teeth in different contexts to the one that you exist in.

Whilst you're unlikely to reach out to folks with a direct request to be their friend, a side-effect of reaching out to many people is that some large fraction of them are likely to become just that. Some of my best friendships have started with speaking to folks about their work. I am consistently flawed by the generosity that people exhibit with regard to their time, knowledge, and emotional energy, amongst other things.

To drive this point home, there are several moments in my career that I would have navigated poorly had it not been for folks offering their time and advice. Earlier in my career, working long hours and completely burned out, I reached out to someone I greatly respected for advice—their suggestion, ultimately, was _it's not going to work, quit your job_. Weird advice that had I not taken would be in a significantly worse position today.

Many pieces of advice won't be quite so drastic, and over the years I've received advice from countless folks that whilst taken in isolation produce small changes in approach and perspective, in aggregate amount to a completely different picture of what it means to be a good design leader; what it means to connect folks with others and to celebrate them for the work that they do; what it means to empower others (inside out outside of the design team) and to create new leaders.

Connecting with people creates optionality for the future in wonderful and unexpected ways. Someone you reach out to today might well be a collaborator in the future. They could be a new teammate, manager, or report. They could be a familiar face when you move to a new city. They could be a friend, or a mentor, or a coach. They could be a co-founder, or an investor, or a sounding board. People are amazing, and most of them are on the internet.

Of course, the more folks you reach out to, the more difficult it becomes to be responsive and attentive. You'll be doing yourself a favour and giving others the respect they deserve if you're intentional about how you manage this. It could be as simple as a list with names and dates or as complex as a relational database with reminders of when you last spoke and what you spoke about. It's the opposite of impersonal to record this.

How you reach out to people is up to you, but I recommend keeping it short and specific. It's often tempting to layer in background, and context, and personal stories, but all of that takes time and energy to parse. Folks have the same 24 hours that you do (and could have many more commitments). Long messages at best get flagged to read later, and the realities of life frequently cause _later_ to extend to infinity.

Finally, remember to be as generous with your time as others are with theirs. There are lots of people on the internet and everyone has something to learn from just about anyone. It's also a frighteningly small world, and you'll want to be known as someone is willing to offer as much as you ask for, as opposed to someone who is very comfortable with receiving wisdom but who very rarely offers their own to others.

## You probably don't need a degree
Whilst this isn't true of every university, most curriculums are wildly outdated compared to the work you'll do in the industry (in both good and bad ways, depending on your perspective), and academics end up with a beautiful but skewed worldview that they'll happily bestow onto you. If you want to work in academia, that's probably great—but if you don't, you might well leave university ill-prepared for the world of work.

Degrees (relative to the output you might create in any given month, day, or hour on the job) take a long time to acquire and even longer to pay back, and whilst it can be liberating to have the time to go deep on theory and the space to take long, winding routes to conclusions (the good kind, anyway, there are bad versions of this), it's true that >= 1 year inside a great company can viably teach you what might take >= 4 years in a classroom.

By the end of that time your grade can feel like the most important thing in the world, but if hiring managers are looking at your degree at all, rarely are they paying close attention to the grade you were awarded. I almost missed out on the grade I was hoping for and was completely devastated, but (and I acknowledge that I say this from a place of privilege) I have not thought about it once since, and neither has anyone else.

I don't say this to challenge the value of academia (and for some folks and roles they could very well be a real requirement)—structured learning and supportive professors can create wonderful environments, and I don't regret my time at university—but I don't believe most folks _need_ a degree, and the lack of one is certainly not something I'd hold against a candidate. To be frank, I can't remember ever having checked if folks have one.

Imagining for a moment that you're in the midst of earning one right this minute (and to avoid causing you dropping out as a result of a blog post from a stranger on the internet), I do believe there are things worth thinking about to supplement your studies and prepare you for the world outside of university walls—I would believe them, because I did them, but doing so has worked out as well as I could have hoped.

Firstly, many design courses feature somewhere between _zero_ and _very little_ practical guidance on business—both the world of business and your specific role in it. Understanding how businesses work and how money works will put ahead of many others by a mile. Understanding your role inside a business will help you to create impact and to be taken seriously (more on this later). Drop into lectures. Read books and blogs. Listen to podcasts.

Secondly, university assignments usually have _very_ comfortable deadlines. Use this to your advantage: don't drag your feet, get the assignment done, and spend the rest of your time learning things that you're not being taught at university. Going into digital product design? Learn about software. Communication design? Learn how to write really, really well. Literally any design? Learn about project management, economics, and law.

Thirdly, take advantage of the fact that many folks and organisations will be especially willing to help students further themselves. Reach out to folks and ask for advice, find out which tools and programs have reduced fees for students (sometimes this reduction reaches zero dollars—sometimes less than zero), figure out which services your university offers to students and take every single offer that seems relevant, schedule permitting.

If you haven't got a degree but you're thinking about attending university, I'm not going to tell you that you shouldn't. What I will say is: think about all of the options available to you and make sure that it's a conscious choice, rather than the obvious (or only) choice. Increasingly there are ways to learn more, faster, and with significantly more optionality, and your discount rate on those things should probably be lower.

If you don't have a degree and either do not want one (or are not in a position to pursue one), and you're worried that it will damage your prospects, I can say with some reasonable level of confidence that your worries are unfounded. Grades live on résumés, and if you're following the advice in the first part of this post, your résumé will be one of the last things people see, not the first. Sell your work to folks who need it, not a score that was assigned to you by someone else.

## Idols are rarely very helpful

An easy trap to fall into early-career (but not exclusively) is putting others on a pedestal. Taking inspiration from folks and appreciating their work is fine, but it can become detrimental when it's used as a measuring stick. They make bad work, too. Everyone makes bad work. You just don't get to see it. If on the way to something you're happy with you create hundreds of things you hate, you're headed in the right direction.

Comparing yourself to others (especially those with many years more experience than you currently have under your belt) is a good way to feel bad about yourself. It isn't a good way to think creatively or to feel adventurous in your creative explorations. You'll very likely _always_ think that many folks on the internet make better work than you do. In some cases, you'll be right. In many, you'll be wrong. I can say with some confidence that if you published your work for others to see, some number of them would feel obvious of your own skills (and it wouldn't be wise for them to draw comparisons, either).

When it's not tempting to compare yourself with those you believe to be more skilled than you, it's tempting to emulate them, instead (either through taking a questionable amount of inspiration or by outright copying). This can be a _great_ way to practice your technical craft early on, but it's not a winning strategy when it comes to publishing your work. The context and constraints applicable to their work is likely to be vastly different to yours. It's not that copying the work is bad in the sense that you should feel guilt, I just believe that you have it in yourself to explore freely. I believe you can do research, and make mistakes, and chip away until you find something that solves the problem you're looking to solve.

On that point, creativity requires divergent thinking. It requires you to get uncomfortable, and to _stay_ uncomfortable. At times, it requires the exact opposite: to feel comfortable, and safe. In my own experience, putting too much emphasis on the work of others afforded neither of those things: you don't have to be uncomfortable in the _making_ of the work if you're taking lots of inspiration from the work of others, and it's difficult to be comfortable in your _thinking_ if you're worried that your efforts still won't be good enough. There's plenty better inspiration for design than _other_ design. Don't restrict your thinking—read a book, take a walk, watch a movie, cook a new dish, whatever. Inspiration comes from all sorts of places, and the thoughts that arrive from those experiences will be entirely move novel than if you spend hours on Dribbble.

All of the above said, _learning_ from folks is great. Learning about their history and background. Their struggles and successes. Their life and family. To do this (assuming they're not prolific and very personal writers) you'll very likely need to speak with them. In my experience, folks are significantly less likely to reach out to people who they consider to be _much better than them_. When I've heard people wax lyrical about this or that person on the internet and subsequently suggested that they might reach out to the person they clearly seem to admire, many say something like "why would that person want to speak to me?". Well, precisely because you're a human that has asked a (hopefully thoughtful) question. Also because folks love speaking about themselves and what they do (mostly because they like to give back, sometimes because it simply feels good, which is fine).

You are good at what you do. You're getting better every day. People, if they don't already, will very much look up to you. Celebrate the work of great people, but don't allow their work to make yours feel lesser by comparison. They don't want that, and they very likely would want you to succeed, and to have fun, and to be happy. All of us have hangups and feel bad about our work—sometimes from time to time, sometimes most days—but the important bit is that we're all trying, and we're all learning. Take the time to learn from other folks, but avoid having lots of idols. Take inspiration from your friends, and your family, and your community. Take inspiration from your own experiences, too—they're unique and have got you to where you are today. They're very likely to take you much further, too.

## Design for business value
- Work to increase usage and reduce churn
- Frame your work with business outcomes
- It's as much facilitation as deliverables
- Be as close as possible to profit centres
- Report on the business outcome you create

## Learn to communicate well
- First impression matters more than you think
- You'll get more people on board with ideas
- Most of your job is communicating ideas well
- Fewer words that create more impact is key
- It helps you do literally everything else better

## Stop using design jargon
- People do not care about things like sprints
- People care about their personal outcomes
- You don't look smart for knowing more things
- Create a space for it with people who care
- Most things you read should not be design

## Learn to critique well
- Critique is about achieving good outcomes
- Critique is not a status update for your team
- Critique is not for fun designer banter
- Invite people that you don't want to invite
- Actually follow up on the feedback given

## Tools don't matter much
- Tools shouldn't alter your chosen solution
- Tools change often and not usually by much
- Your tools don't always create final work
- Tools can become a crutch or distraction
- Match the tools to the stage of the work

## Titles do not equal influence
- Titles don't describe what you do very well
- Titles are sometimes used in lieu of comp.
- Titles can artificially limit your impact
- Titles matter less the more senior you get
- You can choose whatever title you please
